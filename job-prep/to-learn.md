Lock yourself in a room a learn these 5 programming concepts (you'll thank me later):

1. SOLID Principles
The 5 principles of object-orientated programming that creates clean, maintainable and scalable code.

2. Domain-Driven Design
Improve your understanding of complex business domains and learn to model them using DDD principles.

3. Clean Architecture
Structure your code in a way that enforces separation of concerns, promotes testability and ensures your application remains flexible.

4. Test-Driven Development
Write more reliable and maintainable code. Write tests before you write the code to help ensure your code meets the required specifications and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

5. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery
Streamline your software development process, enabling faster delivery through automated builds, tests and deployment.
